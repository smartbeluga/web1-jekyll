title: Herald, The Adventures of Kathlyn, no. 10, 1913
description: 
Herald for episode ten of the Selig serial film The Adventures of Kathlyn. Text on the cover reads, "Selig's Sensational Serial Wild Animal Drama / The Adventures of Kathlyn / No. 10 The Warrior Maid / in Two Reels / Written by Harold MacGrath / Scenario by Gilson Willets." Below the text is a framed space in which "Palace Theatre / Aug 22 & 23" has been written. Text on the back of the herald reads, "No.10 / The Adventures of Kathlyn / The Warrior Maid." Centered underneath the text box are two film stills and a synopsis of episode ten. The herald also includes a cast list and production credits. The cast list includes Kathlyn Williams, Lafayette McKee, Thomas Santschi, Charles Clary, Horace Carpenter and Goldie Colwell.Historical note: The first installment of The Adventures of Kathlyn was released on December 29, 1913 and is often credited as the first real "cliffhanger" serial, as other titles released by Thanhouser and Pathe-Freres were not released until 1914 and 1915. Printed versions of the Kathlyn episodes, written by Harold MacGrath, were published simultaneously in The Chicago Tribune, where they were an enormous success.
